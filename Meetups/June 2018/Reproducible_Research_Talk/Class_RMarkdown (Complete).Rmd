## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Formatting

Plain text

End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph.  

*italics* and _italics_

**bold** and __bold__

superscript^2^

~~strikethrough~~

Table Header | Second Header
-------------|--------------
Table Cell   | Cell 2
Cell 3       | Cell 4

Let's knit again to look at our table.

[Here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf) is a link to the [www.rstudio.com](www.rstudio.com) R Markdown cheat sheet where we got all of the above examples. 

Now let's get back to the code.

CTRL + ALT + i is the shortcut to create a code chunk.

```{r}
#This will provide the session information which can be helpful when sharing documents.
sessionInfo()
```

We can play with the code chunk options. For this demo, we will use `mtcars`. Notice how we set off `mtcars` with the back ticks below the tilde on your keyboard.
You will often see this to delineate packages, functions, datasets, etc. 

```{r}
df <- mtcars
head(df)
```

If we want to load the data and not have it show, we will do `echo = FALSE`.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
df <- mtcars
head(df)
```

If we want to have the code and output collapse into a single block, we will do `collapse = TRUE`.

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
df <- mtcars
head(df)
```

## R Markdown Chunk Options
![](C:\\Users\\e367502\\Desktop\\R Stuff\\R Markdown Chunk Options.png)

Here we can show a scatter plot

```{r}
scat_plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=mpg, y = wt)) +
    geom_point()

scat_plot
```

Let's put in an interactive data table.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
DT::datatable(df, filter = 'top')
```


We can also do inline code with R Markdown which will use code to fill in numbers or text automatically.

The mean mpg in the `mtcars` data set is `r mean(df$mpg)` and the SD is `r sd(df$mpg)`.

We can add in rounding to the mean of `r round(mean(df$mpg), 2)` and the SD of `r round(sd(df$mpg), 2)`.

It is nice because if we get a new data pull, with the code in there it will automatically update. 

For example, if we just take the first 5 rows from `mtcars` we can use the same code with the updated df (e.g. df2) and it is already taken care of.

```{r}
#We will take the first 5 rows
library(dplyr)
df2 <- df[1:5,]
```

The mean mpg in the `df2` data set is `r round(mean(df2$mpg), 2)` and the SD is `r round(sd(df2$mpg), 2)` and the name of the first car is `r rownames(df2[1,])`.

Now we will play with the YAML code which is the code you see at the very top of the R Markdown document.
